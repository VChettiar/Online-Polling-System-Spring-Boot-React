I have built a robust Online Polling System using a combination of Java with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. Here's a refined description of your project that captures its key features and functionalities:

## Online Polling System

### Overview

The Online Polling System is a full-stack application developed using Java with the Spring Boot framework, integrated with Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization. The frontend is managed using React.js, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.

### Key Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Users and admins can log in through a secure login page using their email and password. Spring Security handles authentication, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected.

       - Can cast votes for their preferred options.
       - Restricted from accessing the poll creation page, ensuring that only admins can add new polls.

3. **Poll Management**:
   - Admins can create polls with various options, while users can interact with the existing polls by casting their votes.

4. **Intuitive User Interface**:
   - Built with React.js, the frontend offers a seamless user experience, allowing users to easily navigate between viewing polls and voting.

### Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: (MySQL)
- **Version Control**: Git

### Conclusion

The Online Polling System provides a secure and efficient platform for conducting polls, ensuring that both administrators and users have access to the features pertinent to their roles. With its strong emphasis on security and user experience, this application is well-suited for various polling scenarios.
